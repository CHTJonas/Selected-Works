# CAST 2017 Handover Notes

So, I've finally managed to get around to doing a proper write up of this handover! What follows is an attempt to list everything you need to care about, as well as some stuff that inevitably you don't.

The broad list of things is as follows:

### General
* Each person has half a suitcase for their personal items & effects, and half for tour-related item.
* Before you leave Cambridge during the August rehearsal period you will want to pack everybody's bags, weight them and photograph them.
* Make a list of the contents of everyone's bags so that you can immediately identify which bag to put item X in and who's bag that is.

### Indian River Charter High School, Florida
* Black box theatre.
* Stage area is about 7 metres wide, 4 metres deep roughly.
* Set of double doors leading to an area backstage. These can be removed and fitted with curtains instead. There is also a fire exit door very very downstage right (almost into the audience) which can be used for entrances & exits. The doors at the back used by the audience can also be used for entrances & exits. A combination of all three of these form the get around.
* Backstage area is a small green room-cum-storage area behind the double doors which leads to an art studio classroom which acts as the cast dressing room.
* Seating is raked and can be removed (with a lot of effort) in order to rig/focus the lighting bars.
* Light bars are all fixed (no counterweights or winches). They are more than happy for you to change fixtures/lanterns and for you to re-gel and re-focus.
* There is a very large Genie available to reach the LX bars. It's a proper scissor-lift style machine and is probably twice the length of the ADC's Genie and a slightly larger width. Controls are similar to the ADC's however it can also be used on an inclined slope so there's a few extra features that you need to read the operator's manual for. It's normally stored in what they refer to as the 'dome' and needs to be driven down a corridor with barely enough clearance in order to get it into the theatre.
* Control position as at the rear of the room up a flight of two stairs.
* Venue has a choice of either an ETC SmartFade or ETC Nomad. You'll probably want to ask them to set up for the Nomad so that it's fully compatible with the CAST Nomad and you can just turn up and plug straight in.
* Sound is into a small sound mixer and was just a jack lead into a laptop.
* They also have a selection of Windows PCs & laptops and Apple Macs which they're willing to let you use if you ask nicely.
* Venue contact was the same as the venue tech - guy called Michael Naffziger. He's really nice, friendly and helpful, although for us he was super busy preparing the school for the impending hurricane.

### Sebastian River High School, Florida
* We didn't visit Seb. River due to hurricane Irma and the evacuation of Florida.
* We did however get to spend an extra day in a hotel in North Carolina so I guess that was nice...

### Little Washington, Virginia
* Small very old theatre in a very small town. Think old movie theatre kind of venue.
* Hosts are all very wealthy and have very amazing very large houses, often quite a ways away from the theatre down dirt tracks. Might be something to think about RE: the get in/out.
* Stage is probably about 7 metres wide and maybe 5 metres deep. There are about six large stock white flats that you will probably want to get rid of. We took them outside and put them down on some plastic sheets on the ground.
* Get around is behind a black stage blinder at the back of the stage and under a grand piano (which you can't move off stage).
* Backstage area is small room with some sofas which forms the dressing room. Accessed through a door which is up a few steps from downstage right.
* Not much you can do to re-focus or re-gel their lights...
* Control position is a room above the rear auditorium balcony seating.
* Venue has some sort of large-format ETC two-preset manual lighting desk. Thing a Jester but bigger and older.
* LX control is via DMX into some antiquated ETC dimmer pack, several channels of which are dead.
* Sound is just via a jack lead into a tiny digital mixing desk.
* Venue contact was a lovely lady called Kendra who was an absolute sweetheart. Venue tech was a guy called Hank who is a grumpy old man and a nightmare to deal with. He also gave our Designer, Alice, a massive load of stick about out set being silly and badly constructed and unsafe - probably because he's misogynistic.

### Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
* Typical American high school hall with a flag on the side of the stage (you can remove this but do ask first).
* Stage is about 8 metres wide and maybe 6 deep.
* Set of double doors in the downstage left wing which lead to a corridor.
* Backstage/green room is a classroom just across the corridor. It's a music classroom and full of expensive instruments which you're definitely not allowed to touch so worth telling the cast.
* Get around available behind the black stage curtain at the back.
* Lighting provided by a mixture of ordinary lanterns, moving lights, LED batons and conventional lighting batons.
* Bar 0 can be lowered to ground level to work on it/re-focus/re-gel. It will need to be powered and have control data sent to it from a long cable run from the window of the control box at the back of the auditorium.
* There is a stepladder and a Genie lift available for work at height. The Genie is a static one however and needs four outriggers installed to work which almost makes it too much of a faff to be useful. It can only be used by the venue technician.
* Control box is up a flight of stairs at the back of the auditorium however they never actually operate from there and mostly tend to sit at the back of the auditorium
* LX desk is some kind of ETC console similar to the Jester but with ML controls.
* Sound desk is a massive over-the-top Allen & Heath 32 channel analogue console.
* Venue contact and tech were both friendly and helpful. They will be teaching lessons sometimes during the day so just be aware of that.

### Frostburg, Maryland
* Venue is a concert recital hall, strictly speaking, which comes with it's own set of challenges for staging a theatrical production.
* The stage is massive - we think around 9 metres wide and 10 deep. There is a halfway curtain which you can use to blind the rear half of the stage. Ask them ahead of time if you think you might want this moved further forward or backwards.
* They have acoustic damping in the form of huge curtains at the back of the hall which can be drawn or opened or left somewhere in-between. You'll probably want to keep them all closed.
* There are rigging bars above stage on electric winches however these probably aren't useful to you as they don't rig their lights from them.
* Front wash is provided by about 20 ETC Source Four lanterns on a catwalk and by 4 Source Fours & 8 Source Four Zooms on FOH ladders.
* Toplight is provided by 4 layers of pretty good LED booms above stage.
* There are white workers controllable from the control room or backstage.
* Venue LX control is via and ETC SmartFade. Of course this can be unplugged and the CAST Nomad used with their DMX cable.
* Sound is from QLab via a jack lead into their 16ch Soundcraft sound mixer.
* They have quite a complicated zone mixing system for relays and cluster speakers etc. Just something to be aware of.
* They have a hard maple wooden stage floor and prefer you to use tape to cover any sharp edges of set that may touch. And don't permit black character shoes or any other shoes that will leave marks.
* Stepladders available.
* The venue contact is a bit of a nightmare is is extremely patronising. The venue tech was really nice to us however the previous year had massive problems with him. The key is communication - make sure you chat to him and get to know him and be friendly. Keep him in the loop of what you're doing and ask permission before you done something and you should be fine. 

### St. John Fisher, New York
* Venue is a large hall with removable single chairs for audience seating.
* Stage is about 8 metres wide and 6 metres deep.
* Single door in the upstage left wing which leads to the dressing room. This is actually a catering storage room and they get annoyed if you touch the urns that they keep in there.
* Bars for lighting above stage and one single bar in front of the stage above the first row of chairs.
* Bars are static and must be access using either a medium or very large stepladder.
* Front wash provided by a mixture of Source Four ParNels and profiles.
* Toplight provided by some tungsten lighting batons.
* Sidelight provided by Source Four ParNels.
* LX control is an ETC SmartFade which can of course be switched out for the CAST nomad.
* Sound is a jack lead straight into a Mackie analogue mixing desk.

### Stratford, Connecticut
* Stratford is actually two venues in one.
* The first venue is inside a local High School.
* The second is outside in the middle of a car park next to an abandoned theatre.

#### Inside (High School)
* On our tour the way things worked out meant that our get in happened at 11pm.
* The stage is about 8 metres wide and 6 metres deep, although the wings are filled with junk.
* Lighting bars above stage and one single bar in front of the stage.
* Bars are static and must be access using either a large stepladder.
* There is a catwalk to the front-of-house lighting bar accessed by a ~12 metre unprotected ladder stage right. __I strongly advise against using this or going up to the catwalk.__ Not only is it dangerous to access but the lights up on the catwalk are difficult to reach, difficult to focus, difficult to re-gel and the whole area is caked in dust.
* LX control is via a lighting desk at the back of the auditorium. It's inbuilt into a wooden desk thing. I don't recall being able to use our own control in this venue.
* Sound was setup via a speaker at the side of stage. The equipment for this was stored in a security cage stage right.

#### Outside
* The outside venue is in a car park against a small shack and a few trees.
* There is a nearby house (about 200 metres away) which acts as the offices for the Mighty Quinn Foundation, a local drama group.
* In the house's basement is where they store all of the technical equipment. There are a variety of floodlights and parcans and such. You will probably want to load them into the boots of your cars and then drive from the house to the 'stage'.
* Sound is via a set of portable speakers, fed from an amplifier and sound desk.
* Power for all the lights comes from an outlet on the side of the abandoned theatre. You will need to use several lengths of very long American extension cable.
* The venue contact, who is responsible for housing you as well, 

__Note on the abandoned theatre:__
The abandoned theatre was once fully operational but ceased due to (I believe) bankruptcy. As a result it was largely abandoned overnight and left in the exact state. The outsides are boarded up however the insides are almost identical to when it was abandoned and it's very dangerous. The scenery on the hemps and counterweights has fallen all over the stage and could, for example, fall on you if you were to go inside. I recall that we had to enter the building in order to switch on the power to the outlets on the outside. If you do this you will want to take a party of three people inside, one to stay with someone if they get injured and one to go and get help. You will also want to tell people outside that you're going into the theatre. My general advice is to _stay away if possible_.

### Grand Cayman
* The hotel is amazing! As is the food & drink.
* Venue is a small-ish community theatre on the island.
* Lighting is a variety of Source Four Profiles and ParNels.
* The front lighting bars can be re-geled and refocused but only from a ladder and you need to move the auditorium seats.
* The LX box is upstairs in a small room with a window, similar to the ADC.
* Sound box is from a small box downstairs at the back of the auditorium. They have an X32 sound desk which you will want to plug into and use.
* There is a SM desk at the side of stage left.
* Cayman is the only venue on tour that had an intercom system, so we could chat to amongst ourselves during the show.
* It will be very hot and you will want to use the air conditioning! Make sure the actors keep the backstage and external doors closed otherwise the air con will cut out.

--

That's about it I think! If you have any questions, please just give me an email - I'll be more than happy to offer advice or help. I imagine there will definitely be some things I’ve forgotten about, but it should all be fairly simple.
